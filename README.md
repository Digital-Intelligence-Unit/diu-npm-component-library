# Diu Component Library

This codebase is an Angular Library of our re-usable components for the NHS BI Platform.

## Useful commands

- Run the command `ng build <project-name> --prod` (or `ng build <project-name> --configuration production` for newer versions of Angular) from your workspace folder to build your component, the output files are created in the `dist/<project-name>` folder.
- Run `npm login` from the command line and enter the credentials that you used to sign up to npm in the first step.
- Navigate to the project dist folder with the command `cd dist/<project-name>`
- Run the command `npm publish --ignore-scripts` to publish the component the npm.
- Now go and check out your new Angular component on the npm website at <https://www.npmjs.com/package/project-name>. You can also run `npm info <project-name>` from the command line to see all the metadata info about your package that's stored on the npm registry.

NOTE: To update your package in npm you just need to increment the version number in the package.json file and run npm publish again.
